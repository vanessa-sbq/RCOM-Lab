# Checks

- If a call to write only writes partial data should we retransmit the whole frame or should we just transmit the rest that wasn't actually transmitted.
- In the case where Rx has a fire and cannot send anything anymore, how will Tx know and stop (timers and counter but not working) ?
- Check TODOS.
- Check FIXMES.
- Check printf's.
- Filename is correct ?
- See architectures...
- Check if frees are everywhere they are needed.
- Check returns agains specification.
- Check if Tx running first will affect the program.
- Check if sleeps are removed everywhere.
- Do cable.c verification (w/errors and/or delays ?).
